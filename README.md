# Overview

This is a simple tic tac toe program. This code was written as a means to better learn java through writing a code I have done in several other languages

This program prompts the user for a number 1 through 9, each corresponding to a slot in the tic tac toe board. It allows two players to play, keeping track of turns and plays till a win condition is met, or "cats craddle" aka a tie is reached.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and the Extension Pack for Java in VS Code

# Useful Websites

* [Java T Point](https://www.javatpoint.com/)

# Future Work

* Couldnt' quite get the file part to work. It's there and it exists, but certain things  my resources told me would help didn't actually work as expected. Plus there were so many solutions to look through.
* I could probably improve the display as well.
